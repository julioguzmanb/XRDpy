# XRDpy

**XRDpy** is a general-purpose Python toolkit for X-ray diffraction (XRD) simulation and related utilities, including:
- Polycrystalline XRD simulation (1D/2D/3D workflows)
- Single-crystal diffraction simulation (2D/3D and Bragg-condition scanning)
- CIF-based crystallographic helpers (lattice + reflections)
- A PyQt GUI for interactive use
